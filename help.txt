	How to use FunctionDrawer?
	1. Introduction
	2. Function properties
	3. Setting menu



	1. Introduction

	FunctionDrawer is a software that can be used to draw mathematical images.
	In the background of the image exists a xy-plane, and every pixel value of the image is calculated
	from x and y values corresponding that pixel.
	You can create interesting images with changing colouring settings and calculation function.
	Images can be saved for later edition, and creating .png files is also possible.
	Have a great time with drawing functions!



	2. Function properties

	You can change the calculation function from 'Function' -pane.
	Function calculates pixel values from xy -coordinates of the pixels.
	Be careful with your typing, because software does not accept erroneous functions.
	
	Available operators: +, -, *, /
	
	Available Basic Functions:
	sin(a)		= sin of radian angle a
	cos(a)		= cos of radian angle a
	tan(a)		= tan of radian angle a
	(x)e(a)		= x to the power of a
	log(a)		= natural logarithm of a
	
	Variable syntax:
	x, y		= acceptable variables	
	10x		= 10*x
	1.5y		= 1.5*y
	-5x 		= -5*x
	x2		= x*x
	4y5		= 4*(y^5)
	
	Example Functions:
	y
	x+y
	12x2 + sin(y)
	cos(x2 + y2)
	(5x*y4)/(xe(y))
	log(sin(2x) + cos(-y))*10
	
	
	
	3. Setting menu
	
	From settings you can change color setups and the size of the xy-plane.
	Settings in detail:
	
	Show coordinates:	Shows x,y coordinates and function value of mouse position in upper right corner. 
						
	Set hue:		Sets hue of drawing color. Value must be in range (0, 1). For example, 0.0 = red, 0.15 = yellow, 0.3 = green, 0.6 = blue
						
	Set saturation:		Sets saturation of drawing color. Value must be in range (0, 1). For example, 1.0 = Full color, 0.0 = Full grey.
						
	Set brightness:		Sets brightness of drawing color. Value must be in range (0, 1). For example, 1 = Full brightness, 0 = Full black
							
	Set drawing mode:	Defines how pixel hue, saturation and brightness are changed by function values.
	
	Drawing modes:

	1: Only brightness changes
	2: Only saturation changes
	3: Only hue changes
	4: Brightness and saturation changes
	5: Brightness and hue changes
	6: Hue and saturation changes
	7: Hue, saturation and brightness changes
						
	Set minimum		Function values are scaled to range (0, 1) for drawing purposes.
	drawing limit:		Values below minimum drawing limit are scaled to 0.	

	Set maximum		Function values are scaled to range (0, 1) for drawing purposes.
	drawing limit:		Values over maximum drawing limit are scaled to 1.	

	Set minimum x:		Sets the x-coordinate value in the left edge of the image.
	
	Set maximum x:		Sets the x-coordinate value in the right edge of the image.
	
	Set minimum y:		Sets the y-coordinate value in the top edge of the image.
	
	Set maximum y:		Sets the y-coordinate value in the bottom edge of the image.
